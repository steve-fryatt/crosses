<chapter title="Installing Crosses" file="Install">

<cite>Crosses</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 or later, and can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc. To install <cite>Crosses</cite> on a hard disc, copy the <file>!Crosses</file> application to a suitable place on your disc.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Crosses" file="Use">

<cite>Crosses</cite> plays Noughts and Crosses. To start the application, double-click on <file>!Crosses</file> in the directory viewer to place it on the iconbar. Clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on its icon will open the game window.

By default, X moves first with the computer playing O. Click on a grid square to place an X; the computer will then place an O to follow it. If the computer player is turned off, clicks on the grid will alternately place Xs and Os.

The game ends when either one of the players gets a row of three of their symbols, or the board is full; in the latter case, the game is considered a draw. A new game can be started by clicking <mouse>menu</mouse> over the game window and selecting <menu>New game</menu>; selecting <menu>Reset scores</menu> will reset the scoreboard.

If the current game has finished, clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on Crosses&rsquo; iconbar icon will also start a new game.


<subhead title="Changing the game options">

A number of options can be selected by selecting <menu>Choices...</menu> from the iconbar menu to access the <window>Choices</window> dialogue.

The <icon>Player&nbsp;X</icon> and <icon>Player&nbsp;O</icon> sections allow the two players to be configured. Selecting <icon>Player&rsquo;s name</icon> allows a name to be entered into the field below: this will then be used instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; in the game window.

Under <icon>Player&nbsp;O</icon>, the <icon>Computer player</icon> option will allow the person playing O to be switched between human and computer.

The <icon>Scoring</icon> section allows some control over the way that games are scored. The <icon>Score draws</icon> option controls whether drawn games count towards the scoreboard values (being attributed to both players). The <icon>Count games</icon> option can be turned on to display the number of games in the scoreboard.

Once the options have been set, clicking <icon>Set</icon> will apply them. Clicking <icon>Cancel</icon> with <mouse>select</mouse> will forget any changes and close the dialogue; with <mouse>adjust</mouse> it will reset the dialogue to the state it was in when it was last opened.
