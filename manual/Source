<subhead title="Changing the game options">

Following the <menu>Options</menu> entry in the iconbar menu allows various things to be set up.  Selecting either of the <icon>Player's name</icon> options and typing a name into the box will replace the X and O in the messages in the main window.  You can make the computer play O by selecting <icon>Computer player</icon>. <icon>Score draws</icon> will give 1 point to each side in the event of a draw, <icon>Count games</icon> will keep a running total of how many you have played. <icon>Reset Scores</icon> and <icon>New Game</icon> do exactly as they say.

When the game is over, clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on the iconbar will clear the board as well.
